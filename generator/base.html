        reduced opacity on darkmode but this would mean that you can see the nav bar behind it so the image needs a
        solid colour background to not reveal anything behind it. The image also couldnt exist inside the normal
        <header> because then I would also lower the opacity of the header text and I didnt want that. -->

                    Hey! We’re the Euros. In case you haven’t heard of us before, we are a speedrun/challenge clan
                    growing in the community.
                    We strive to be the best we can, while teaching others along the way.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    <strong>How it all started</strong>
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    Wami always wanted to do something “more” with PvE in Destiny. He had seen all the speedruns from
                    clans
                    like Redeem or the solo raids from people like Slayerage.
                    The main problem he had is that he didn’t have
                    a team to play with. Eventually he met another Dutch guy while watching twitch called: “Obliviatum.”
                    That’s where it all started. He had some friends that were interested in doing challenges and
                    speedruns
                    and we pretty much used LFG to find others like us.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    We did our first speedrun on <a target="_blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rXjWzX1pLRc">
                        Wrath of the Machine</a> and we were surprised how “well” it went and from that point we just
                    started improving ourselves.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    When we started speedrunning we didn’t think of a name and also didn’t have a clan yet. <a
                        target="_blank" href="https://www.speedrun.com/user/rpotts"> Rpotts </a> who helped us out with
                    getting into those speedruns eventually called us Euros. More and more people were starting to do
                    the same thing cause we were the only team that had six players in Europe. We didn’t think much of
                    it until we were getting faster and faster in those speedruns and felt like we should have a name
                    like Route and Redeem to represent ourselves with. That’s where we pretty much just said “why not
                    Euros?” And that still stuck with us, even though we picked up a lot of players from outside of
                    Europe.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    To this day the clan has kept its history to have mostly EU players.
