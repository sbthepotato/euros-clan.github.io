This is the code for the website of euros, a destiny clan.

https://euros-clan.com/

While the website it self isn't particularly interesting because graphic design isn't my passion, The stuff in '/generator' is. 
Its a quick and easy method to automatically generate all the player cards on the website so that removing people or changing their pictures is 
as simple as it can be. The logic is explained in comments in the code it self.
